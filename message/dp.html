          <p>Hey Yenaa.</p>

          <p>
            There's not much that I want to say really, I feel like this website
            is already a good enough gift for you. You deserve more, but as a
            friend, I think this is good enough. You had helped me through with
            so much, and I can't repay that kindness, I don't even know how.
          </p>

          <p>
            I hope, I can only hope this is enough for your Birthday HAHAHAH
            I've changed as a person and lowkey I was scared that because I
            hadn't show you this like newer side of me, but you just acted the
            same.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't even know how you're a real person T-T. You are, the nicest,
            the most hard working and empathetic person I've ever met. The world
            is full of suprises but you're the best suprise someone could ever
            come apon HAHAHA
          </p>

          <p>
            There's isn't much more that I want to say really, this website is
            what I feel like is the least I can do. I remember that you had drew
            me a bird profile picture for us to match and I still remember to
            this day. I figured that since you had made me something with your
            skills that means alot to me, I hope I can bring as much joy as you
            had given me with this website.
          </p>

          <div class="center">
            <p>
              Happy Birthday Yen, I hope our pets can meet eachother one day
            </p>
